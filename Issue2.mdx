### SL (Steam Locomotive)

Created in 1993 by Toyoda Masashi, this useless but funny command is a play on the `ls` command used in terminals. It creates a visual of a steam locomotive (hence the name SL) every time it is typed.

If you were on the internet from the 90s to the early 2000s you will remember how google search used to give straight up results. Nowadays the internet is focused on SEO and running advertisements, as opposed to finding the best information. Many of the websites nowadays look all too familiar, focusing on garnering clicks to contribute to their advertisement revenue. This post talks about how we go to this point, and the major names behind it.

### The World Depends On Old Code
[https://www.pcmag.com/articles/ibms-plan-to-update-cobol-with-watson](https://www.pcmag.com/articles/ibms-plan-to-update-cobol-with-watson)

This article talks about how a large portion of the worlds business and banking systems run off of the programming language COBOL. Since the language is so old, many of the programmers are exiting the workforce. This is making large code-bases written in COBOL hard to maintain, since there are not many new engineers learning the language. The article goes on to talk about how IBM may be using AI to help solve the problem.
