City Pop is a genre of Japanese Pop music that emerged in the late 70's, becoming most popular in the 80's. It would gain international popularity in the early 2010's, and continues to be popular among young music lovers. As you listen you will notice that the majority of the songs have ties to leisure, and romance. Almost every other song has to do with either a breezy summer day, a lonely nighttime scene, or a romantic encounter.

I have personally been a huge fan of City Pop for the past couple years. Since I do not speak Japanese, it makes for simple listening. The vocals are extremely soothing and my mind does not need to process the lyrics. Combining this with the beautifully crafted beats makes it one of my top genres of all time. While some of the albums I enjoy are available on my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/e9t94vj3ngcmx7j2kd3hnldc7), you may find some of them difficult to locate online. 

Physical media such as vinyl's, cassettes, and CD's are the preferred listening choice for many overseas, but they are also expensive. If you wish to download any of the songs/albums below, I would recommend checking out this [article](https://blog.mikekudrik.boats/posts/SurfingSoulseek) of mine or searching the web for jpop80ss. YouTube is also a great tool and contains amazing City pop compilations. Now onto the list. 🎧

## Hand-Picked Summer Favorites 

*DISCLAIMER: The following list is in no particular order and is not ranked.* 

### 1. Memories In Beach House – Seaside Lovers – 1983

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/seasideLovers.jpg" alt="Seaside Lovers Cover"/>

You know how they always say that you shouldn't judge something by it's cover? Well when it comes to this [album](https://www.discogs.com/master/597812-Masataka-Matsutoya-Akira-Inoue-Hiroshi-Sato-Seaside-Lovers--Memories-In-Beach-House) you should do just that. It is considered a holy grail for collectors. This gem transports you to a sun-drenched paradise where all your worries fade away. It is a collaboration of three of the biggest keyboard giants of the time: Akira Inoue, Hiroshi Sato, and Masataka Matsutoya. 

The album is a lush soundscape, weaved together by island-esque rhythms, odd bass lines, and the beloved synthesizers commonly associated with City Pop. Perfect for doing just as seen in the cover: lounging by the pool with a drink in hand. Right off the bat, the album starts strong with the track "Lovers Paradise" which is almost iconic in its sound and contains awesome vocals sung in English. Near the middle of the album is one of my personal favorites, "X's And O's". Finally, it finishes in an interesting way. Stepping slightly out of place with the song "Blue Memories," which includes a more melancholy feel. 

The album is on Spotify, but some of the songs are unavailable due to licensing issues, something that is common. Regardless, I would give it a listen, wherever you may find it. 

### 2. Pacific – Haruomi Hosono, Shigeru Suzuki, Tatsuro Yamashita – 1978

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/pacific.jpg" alt="Pacific Cover"/>

This [album](https://www.discogs.com/master/408982-%E7%B4%B0%E9%87%8E%E6%99%B4%E8%87%A3-%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8%E8%8C%82-%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%8B%E9%81%94%E9%83%8E-Pacific) takes listeners on yet another journey to a sunny place. That place is the Pacific, of course! Much like the last album, this one comprises three titans of the Japanese music scene. The songs will take you to an island in the South Pacific, specifically Motu Fara, a small island in the Avatoru Pass that is seen in the iconic album cover. This is my album of choice for sailing or just kicking back. The artists are each known for distinct styles, but they came together and created this masterpiece. Tatsuro Yamashita is a key name and one of my top artists of all time. We will talk more about him specifically later. 

Songs such as "Coral Reef" and "Nostalgia of Island" are easily top choices. They deliver that laid-back energy that all summers need. The exotic percussion adds a layer of dreaminess that makes you wish the song would never end. "Noa Noa" is an amazing track that has almost a nostalgic feel, giving you that excitement you may have had visiting the beach as a kid. I'd like to refer back to "Nostalgia of Island," and point out that it contains a Beach Boys sample of "Girls on the Beach" at around 7:50. This alone made it my favorite in the album.

### 3. Big Wave – Tatsuro Yamashita – 1984

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/bigWave.jpg" alt="Big Wave Cover"/>

Where do I start? If you know me personally, you may have heard me call this album perfect, and it is just that. Here's the chorus:
> We've got summer right here in our hearts  
And we move with the tide  
We just float in the sun 'til the big wave comes  
Then we ride, ride, ride 

This [album](https://www.discogs.com/master/742675-Tats-Yamashita-%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%8B%E9%81%94%E9%83%8E-Big-Wave-%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96) is the result of the king of city pop (yes, that's his actual title) creating a song that captures *surfing* and *summer*. Before I get into the actual music, I want to inform you that this album is actually the soundtrack for a surfing film under the same name, which follows big wave surfers as they catch awesome waves on the North Shore of Oahu and Maui. The movie is narrated by none other than [Kamasami Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamasami_Kong), and is available, though in low quality, on YouTube. 

*Big Wave* actually peaked second on the weekly charts in Japan during its release. And there's no surprise. It features breezy melodies reminiscent of classic Californian surf rock. It includes covers of "Darlin" and "Please Let Me Wonder" from none other than the Beach Boys. Yamashita was able to capture the band's pure essence while adding his own stylistic touch. Although I could easily write a paragraph on each track, I am going to highlight some of my favorites. The covers are obviously great, and I have nothing to say except you should listen to them. "Jody" is amazing and almost impossible to get out of your head after hearing it. Next, "Magic Ways" showcases Tatsuro's knack for catchy melodies and infectious grooves. Finally, I would recommend the song "This Could Be The Night" as it is the perfect song for a summer night or a slow dance under the stars. 

I love this album so much that I even decided to burn it as a CD to keep in my car! (Shhh! Don't tell Tatsuro). Head to YouTube and give it a listen!

### 4. Sea Breeze - Toshiki Kadomatsu - 1981

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/seaBreeze.jpg" alt="Sea Breeze Cover"/>

This [album](https://www.discogs.com/master/547279-Toshiki-Kadomatsu-Sea-Breeze) is yet another breath of fresh air, perfect for the summer. It is a foundational work in the City Pop genre and blends funky grooves, synths, and, of course, the amazing vocals of one of the coolest looking guys, Toshiki Kadomatsu. The original album is amazing, but there is also [another version](https://www.discogs.com/release/12923548-Toshiki-Kadomatsu-Surf-Break-From-Sea-BreezeKamasami-Kong-DJSpecial) that blends vocals from [Kamasami Kong](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3930689-Kamasami-Kong) whom I previously mentioned. He is a disc jockey and lifelong radio host who talked over the songs from Kadomatsu's album as if it were his radio show. But back to the actual album.

*Sea Breeze* combines elements of funk, pop, rock, and jazz. The first song, "Dancing Shower," is an amazing creation that sets the rest of the album up. It has some of the best bass lines I have heard. It really does stick to its name and make you want to dance. After that is the song "Elena" which, much like Yamashita's "Jody" will stay in your head for hours after listening. The fourth song, "Surf Break" is slower and almost acts as a relief during the album, allowing you to step back and slow down.

Another perfect summer album from Kadomatsu is *Sea Is A Lady*. Go give them a listen!

### 5. Omega Tribe 35th Anniversary - S. Kiyotaka & Omega Tribe - 2018

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/omegaTribe35th.jpg" alt="Omega Tribe 35th Anniversary Cover"/>

I simply could not decide on a single album when it comes to Sugiyama Kiyotaka & Omega Tribe. Omega Tribe has a very interesting history, as the music project went through multiple iterations, starting with the one mentioned here. They would later be known as the 1986 Omega Tribe. Their music is something else. 

I chose the 35th Anniversary Album for a few reasons. First, it serves as a great introduction to the band, since it plays most of their hits. Second, it is accessible on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4wTWmnZDG7gTCxmRqgPgXB?si=XNXHoWt6TxarQWTpKIo4VQ), and finally it includes a DJ special by, you guessed it, Kamasami Kong. The compilation has both tracks with and without the iconic DJ's voice. A cool fact is that Kamasami Kong actually came up with the name Omega Tribe. Anyhow, onto the music.

My first and probably favorite song in here is "River's Island," which you may have heard before. With vocals preformed by Sugiyama, it makes yet another great song to play while cruising the beach with windows rolled down. It is the title track from their second album. Next, "Misty Night Cruising" is one of their more popular songs, and it's not hard to see why. It leaves a melancholic and introspective feel, fitting of its title. The lyrics depict two of the things city pop songs typically have. Like I mentioned in my intro, this songs lyrics talk about a late-night car ride with a potential love interest. 

### 6. Summer Breeze - Piper - 1983

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/summerBreeze.jpg" alt="Summer Breeze Cover"/>

My list would simply be incomplete without this album mentioned. Piper was a band led by vocalist Keisuke Yamamoto, and they only released a few albums. Despite its low popularity at the time of release, it has now gained cult status among City Pop fans. Lyrically, the songs are light and breezy, just as the title suggests. It serves as a good example of the West's influence on city pop through disco and funk. 

The title song, "Summer Breeze," is easily one of the best in the album, delivering exactly as promised by the title. Upbeat tempos, synths, and a laid-back groove leave the feeling of warm winds touching your skin. Next is my personal number one, "Gentle Shower," which starts with a brief instrumental interlude providing a moment of stillness. Then, its smoothing melodies are like the tranquility found in taking a steamy shower. The album ends strong with "Moonlight Beach". 

### 7. Paraiso - Haruomi Hosono & The Yellow Magic Orchestra - 1978

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/paraiso.jpg" alt="Paraiso Cover"/>

While this album, might not be specifically considered City Pop, I wanted to add it to the list in order to spice things up a bit. By no means does this sound like most of the other songs, as it is one of the more experimental albums listed. If you've been paying attention, you will recognize Hosono as being one of the artists who created Pacific, which we talked about in number two. "Asatoya Yunta," is definitely one of the more far-out songs, but I think some of you may enjoy the odd take. My personal favorite is "Worry Beads." In my opinion, it is the closest to being a summer groove compared to the rest of the songs. It contains a [mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra) that really flows well. Give it a listen and let me know if you agree. Finally, the title song, "Paraiso" does a great job of wrapping up the album. 

### 8. Jolly Jive - Masayoshi Takanaka - 1979

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/jollyJive.jpg" alt="Jolly Jive Cover"/>

This album is more Jazz Fusion than it is City Pop, but I digress. Takanaka has an amazing fan base, and usually as he walks out, the concert audience will yell "TAKANAKA!" For me, he easily ranks among my top guitarists of all time. This album is perfect for summer listening. Songs like "Blue Lagoon" display incredible guitar riffs that captivate the listener and leave them yearning for more. "Taj Mahal" is an extremely catchy song and offers a great experience. Finally, "Bamboo Vender" is popular among fans. 

Masayoshi Takanaka is one of the artists whose music is so refined that it is nearly impossible for him to miss. Some other albums that I enjoy from him are *Takanaka*, *An Insatiable High*, *On Guitar*, and *Brasilian Skies* of course. But I would also encourage you to watch his live performances on YouTube, as his stage presence is unmatched.

### 9. Timely! - Anri - 1983

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/timely!.jpg" alt="Timely! Cover"/>

While this [album](https://www.discogs.com/master/965114-Anri-2-%E6%9D%8F%E9%87%8C-Timely-%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A0%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC) is not as overall summer-themed as the rest, it contains some songs that are very distinctly summer-related. This is easily one of the largest City Pop albums ever in terms of popularity. Anri has some of the best female vocals in general, I would say. *Timely!* focuses more on sophistication, with polished arrangements and tasteful instrumentation. It might evoke the feeling of a summer spent on a rooftop bar with a view of a city. It perfectly reflects the highs and lows that come with every summer by offering a variety of moods. 

"Windy Summer" is the second track and is perfect for your summer playlist. The next two songs are some of my favorites in general when it comes to the genre. "The Sadness Never Ends" has one of the most catchy lines thus far. I may be biased since it's the only sentence spoken in English on the track, but hey, it's still amazing. And finally, the classic, "Shyness Boy." The song speaks of a woman falling for a shy dude. It is an overall playful song about the classic dynamic between a man and a woman, where the woman takes the lead in expressing her feelings. 

### 10. Songs (# ソングス) - Sugar Babe - 1975

<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkudrik/BlogPosts/main/images/Music1/songs.jpg" alt="Songs Cover"/>

My final recommendation is the [album](https://www.discogs.com/master/398344-Sugar-Babe-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%99%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96-Songs-%E3%82%BD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B9) *Songs* by the band Sugar Babe which is [composed of](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComeAlongRadio/comments/eyh32j/sugar_babe_history_review/) two of the biggest names in City Pop: Yamashita whom we know well by now, and another well known name, Taeko Onuki who sang the iconic song "4:00A.M." These two had the help of Eiichi Ohtaki who also was a wonderful artist. In addition to that, there are other members who were even long time friends of Yamashita's, appearing as backing vocals in his album that I listed in the next section. 

The most enjoyable song in this album for me is "Down Town," since it is catchy yet carries an awesome tone throughout. A close follow-up has to be "How is today? (今日はなんだか)." I also like the demo version of "Show". Overall, an enjoyable album, especially if you Re as huge of a fan of Tatsuro Yamashita as I am (you should be by now).

Catch you later - Mike ^_^
