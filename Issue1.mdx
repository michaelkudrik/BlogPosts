Obsidian is a customizable note taking application that utilizes markdown files. I quite like this method of taking notes with markdown as it allows easy formatting.

AppFlowy is another great open source alternative to a popular application. It works much like Notion and acts as a centralized place for tasks, notes, and projects.

Recently, we have been working with JavaFX within my intro to computer science class. While browsing github, I found this interesting gauge library which can be incorporated. The creator of this library has many other JavaFX related things, so check him out.
