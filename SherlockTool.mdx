## What is Sherlock?
[Sherlock](https://sherlock-project.github.io/) is a powerful command line tool written in python and used to find usernames across many social networks. 

## Installation 
```python
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git

# change the working directory to sherlock
$ cd sherlock

# install the requirements
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the above, you can run python3 sherlock.py from inside the /sherlock folder to see the below help menu.
```python
$ python3 sherlock --help
usage: sherlock [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--folderoutput FOLDEROUTPUT]
                [--output OUTPUT] [--tor] [--unique-tor] [--csv]
                [--site SITE_NAME] [--proxy PROXY_URL] [--json JSON_FILE]
                [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--print-all] [--print-found] [--no-color]
                [--browse] [--local] [--nsfw]

Sherlock: Find Usernames Across Social Networks (Version 0.14.2)

positional arguments:
  USERNAMES             One or more usernames to check with social networks.
                        Check similar usernames using {%} (replace to '_', '-', '.').

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             Display version information and dependencies.
  --verbose, -v, -d, --debug
                        Display extra debugging information and metrics.
  --folderoutput FOLDEROUTPUT, -fo FOLDEROUTPUT
                        If using multiple usernames, the output of the results will be
saved to this folder.
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        If using single username, the output of the result will be saved
                        to this file.
  --tor, -t             Make requests over Tor; increases runtime; requires Tor to be
                        installed and in system path.
  --unique-tor, -u      Make requests over Tor with new Tor circuit after each request;
                        increases runtime; requires Tor to be installed and in system
                        path.
  --csv                 Create Comma-Separated Values (CSV) File.
  --xlsx                Create the standard file for the modern Microsoft Excel
                        spreadsheet (xslx).
  --site SITE_NAME      Limit analysis to just the listed sites. Add multiple options to
                        specify more than one site.
  --proxy PROXY_URL, -p PROXY_URL
                        Make requests over a proxy. e.g. socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
  --json JSON_FILE, -j JSON_FILE
                        Load data from a JSON file or an online, valid, JSON file.
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Time (in seconds) to wait for response to requests (Default: 60)
  --print-all           Output sites where the username was not found.
  --print-found         Output sites where the username was found.
  --no-color            Don't color terminal output
  --browse, -b          Browse to all results on default browser.
  --local, -l           Force the use of the local data.json file.
  --nsfw                Include checking of NSFW sites from default list.
```
## Scanning for Accounts
Before searching for accounts, you need to identify the username of the person you would like to search for. In sake of the tutorial, I will use the username that was used on their readme page: *hackerman1337*. 
```python
~/sherlock$ python3 sherlock hackerman1337
```
### Result:
We will get a list of websites that have accounts under that username. _It's important to note that many of these websites/accounts have nothing to do with the real person. Many times, people will use the same username as a person such as for a fan account._ You can click on links from the results to be brought to the website that holds the account by that username.
